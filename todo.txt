-- for each class used by NN2Dlong,
    need it to be able to report the
    expected memory use by heap and 
    largest temporary memory used by stack.

-- for NN2DLong caches, consider using WeakHashMap instead even though
    it takes up more memory.
         
-- add unit tests where missing
-- has trove implemented a primitive based balanced binary tree?
   if yes, YFastTrieLong could use them

-- consider porting the c judyarray to java:
