-- update the JUnit library and make any needed changes

-- consider implementing a 3D voronoi

-- consider refactoring the code for permutations (Shuffle), combinations
   and partitions to place in one package/directory.

-- for improving the current NearestNeighbor2DLong
   could consider locality based hashing along y axis.

-- when begin to include more than 2 dimensions in clustering project,
   consider adding the vantage point tree for nearest neighbor search

-- add unit tests where missing

-- consider importing some of code stored elsewhere, like the linear programming simplex
     method and tests in minCostFlow

-- consider moving to this project, the notes and code related to feature hashing
   in progress.
   -- related is adding compression to the bit vectors in VeryLongBitString.
      -- consider adding RoaringBitmap java implementation
      -- consider adding simple fast lite compression in bitmap encoding and decoding notes
   -- "Handling Massive N-Gram Datasets"

-- clean up the multiply and dot operations in MatrixUtil

-- consider http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/bibli/local/Bengio2004Learning.pdf
