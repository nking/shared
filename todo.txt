-- add unit tests where missing

-- move code and tests from the curvature scale space project to here:
     - KNearestNeighbors and the classes it uses:
         - VoronoiFortunesSweep
         - FixedSizeSortedVector
         - PairFloat
         - KDTreeFloat
         --> consider improving the code by using trove maps
         -- portions of MultiArrayMergeSort
     - KDE:
         - consider making a 1D atrous wavelet using the TriangleFunction
           scaling function...
           
-- build the javadocs and coverage reports and commit them
