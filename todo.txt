-- as soon as RedBlackBSTLongInt2 is debugged,
   replace the maps with a class like PairIntArray
    for key long, and values long, int, long, long, int, int
    reducing the number of long keys from 6 to 1

-- put the latest primitive red black tree 
   into the yfast trie long and update its rt and memory 
   commnts.

-- for improving the current NearestNeighbor2DLong
   could consider locality based hashing along y axis.

-- when begin to include more than 2 dimensions in clustering project,
   consider adding the vantage point tree for nearest neighbor search
