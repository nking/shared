/**
 * objective function implementations for use with search algorithms using
 * IFunction as input for the geometric-median.
 *
 * calculating the geometric median: definition: the point which minimizes the
 * sum of the euclidean distance of that point to all other points in the set.
 * the sum is a convex function (i.e. local search will work). Unfortunately, no
 * algorithms are closed form, that is no algorithms have a finite number of
 * computational operations. The geometric median is a rotation and translation
 * invariant estimator that achieves the optimal breakdown point of 0.5, i.e. it
 * is a good estimator even when up to half of the input data is arbitrarily
 * corrupted. 
 *

 *
 * given observed data points obs = (x_i, y_i,
 * ...) want to solve for X=(x_geo_median, y_geo_median, ...). X = arg min of ||
 * X-obs ||_2, that is, the X which minimizes the sum of the differences where
 * _2 is notation for using L2 (euclidean) distances.
 *
 * The weighted geometric median is known as the Weber problem.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   f = summation_i=1_n( w_i * || X - obs_i || )/n
 *      where || X - obs_i ||_2 is ( (X_0-obs_i_0)^2 + (X_1-obs_i_1)^2 ...)^(1/2)
 * </pre>
 *
 *  -- iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRLS)
        given observed points Z_I=(x_i, y_i)
        and wanting to solve for X=(x_median, y_median)
        let weight w_i = 1/( || X-z_i || )
        note that the geometric median usually uses equal weights w_i=1/n

        the cost function to minimize C_w(X) = summation_i=1_n( w_i*|| X-z_i ||^2 )
        set deriv to zero
        then iterated updates of estimates of X in time steps t:
           X_(t+1) = summation_i=1_n( w_t*z_i ) / summation_i=1_n( w_t^2 )

        for L1 version given by Ostresh:
           X_(t+1) = X_t - alpha*summation_i=1_n( w_t*z_i / || X-z_i || ) /
                       summation_i=1_n( w_t / || X-z_i || )

        the gradient of the Riemannian sum-of-distances function is given by
           grad( f(X) ) = -summation_i=1_n( w_i*Log(X_i) / (X-z_i))

           using a steepest descent iteration with step size alpha:
               X_(t+1) = Exp_(X_t)( alpha * v_t)
           where
               v_t = summation_i=1_n( w_i*Log(X_i) / (X-z_i)) /
                       summation_i=1_n( w_i / (X-z_i))
           authors found alpha=1 leads to convergence

      *IRLS, can use the Weiszfeld algorithm for geometric median:
         Two steps:
           (1) w_i = 1/[max(|| X-obs_i ||_2, delta)]
           (2) X = (summation_i=1_n(w_i*obs_i))/(summation_i=1_n(w_i))
                       where (2) is derived from setting the deriv to zero for:
                                 X = minimum X in (summation_i=1_n(w_i*(obs_i-X_i)^2))
         And a strategy for optimization:
            fix X{y} and minimize f with respect to X{x},
            fix X{x} and minimize f with respect to X{y},
            and repeat:
              for i ‚Üê 1, 2, . . .
                 X{y}_i+1 = min_(X{y}) f(X{x}_i+1, X{y}) . Optimize X{y} with X{x} fixed
                 X{x}_i+1 = min_(X{x}) f(X, X{y}_i) . Optimize X{x} with X{y} fixed

*  NOTE that the initial point for the algorithm should be within bounds of the 
      data.
      
 * TODO: consider including observational errors. Those would affect the
 * starting point estimate and the weights.
