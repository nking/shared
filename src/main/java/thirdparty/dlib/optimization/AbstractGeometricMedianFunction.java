/**
 * objective function implementations for use with search algorithms using IFunction
 * as input for the geometric-median.
 * 
   calculating the geometric median:
   definition: the point which minimizes the sum of the euclidean distance of that 
     point to all other points in the set.
     the sum is a convex function (i.e. local search will work).
     Unfortunately, no algorithms are closed form, that is no algorithms have a
     finite number of computational operations.
     The geometric median is a rotation and translation invariant estimator that 
     achieves the optimal breakdown point of 0.5, i.e. it is a good estimator
     even when up to half of the input data is arbitrarily corrupted.
     (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2897518.2897647)
    
    It's the Fermat-Weber problem.
    given observed data points obs = (x_i, y_i, ...)
    want to solve for X=(x_geo_median, y_geo_median, ...).
    X = arg min of || X-obs ||_2, that is, the X which minimizes the
    sum of the differences where _2 is notation for using L2 (euclidean) distances.
    
      <pre>
      f = summation_i=1_n( || X - obs_i || )/n     
               where || X - obs_i ||_2 is ( (X_0-obs_i_0)^2 + (X_1-obs_i_1)^2 ...)^(1/2)
      df/dX_0 = (0.5/n) * ( (X_0-obs_i_0)^2 + (X_1-obs_i_1)^2 ...)^(-1/2) * (-2*(X_0-obs_i_0))
              = (-1./n) * (X_0-obs_i_0) / ( (X_0-obs_i_0)^2 + (X_1-obs_i_1)^2 ...)^(1/2)
      df/dX_1 = (-1./n) * (X_1-obs_i_1) / ( (X_0-obs_i_0)^2 + (X_1-obs_i_1)^2 ...)^(1/2)          
      </pre>
    
     The weighted geometric median is known as the Weber problem.
     
     IRLS, can use the Weiszfeld algorithm for geometric median:
         Two steps:
           (1) w_i = 1/[max(|| X-z_i ||_2, delta)]
           (2) X = (summation_i=1_n(w_i*z_i))/(summation_i=1_n(w_i))
                       where (2) is derived from setting the deriv to zero for:
                           X = minimum X in (summation_i=1_n(w_i*(z_i-X_i)^2))
         And a strategy for optimization:
            fix X{y} and minimize f with respect to X{x},
            fix X{x} and minimize f with respect to X{y},
            and repeat:
              for i ‚Üê 1, 2, . . .
                 X{y}_i+1 = min_(X{y}) f(X{x}_i+1, X{y}) . Optimize X{y} with X{x} fixed
                 X{x}_i+1 = min_(X{x}) f(X, X{y}_i) . Optimize X{x} with X{y} fixed
            
   TODO: consider including observational errors.  Those would affect the starting point 
   estimate and the weights.
