The unit test for N = 1<<16 = 65536 length input array produced
the following results when run on a computer with these characteristics:

Summary:  ispc method performed better than a serial per element product calculation
in terms of completing a correct answer ~5 times faster.

measurements taken using computer w/
    level 3 Cache: 3 MB shared (not used here)
    Cache Level 1:  32k for each core
    Cache Level 2:  256k for each core
    max memory bus: 26 GB/sec
    processor : 1.6 GHz

    at each cycle, memory can transfer at most:
        max memory bus (26 GB/sec) * (sec/1.6G cycles) = 16 Bytes / cycle
          = 128 bits / cycle
        and max memory bus rate is possibly not the mean rate.

          N = 1<<16 = 65536

          8192 foreach i=0...N  parallel invocations
          1024 foreach i=0...N
          128  foreach i=0...N
          16   foreach i=0...N
          2    foreach i=0...N


          loops 5 times:
             allocates a new array N/8 size for results
             enters foreach i=0...N parallel invocation
                vecprod is invoked in parallel
             exits foreach // all gangs completed their work
             N /= 8
          serial multiplication of < 8 items in result array

          vecprod:
              # of 8-wide vec accesses: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
              # of 8-wide vec multiplications: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

           arithmetic intensity = flops / data load/stores in bytes

           we know from separate measurements that a data load/store ~ 18 clock cycles.
           the method ispc_function total time ~ 80 cycles.
           and the time for multiplication is nearly negligible in comparison.
           so the algorithm, running on the above CPU is memory bound.
           

NOTE that using a 16-wide vector did not improve the total runtime, presumably
because loading the vector is memory bound for the computer used for measurements.
    max memory bus (26 GB/sec) * (sec/1.6G cycles) = 16 Bytes / cycle
       = 128 bits / cycle
    and a 16-wide 32-bit vector is 512 bits.
