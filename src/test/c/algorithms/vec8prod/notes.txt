for the vec8prod task;
    ispc can perform better (faster runtime exec) than serial execution.
    6 times better for test data of length 1<<16.

    the simd and multithread versions do not use
    thread pools. the execution runtimes are dominated by context switches,
    and so are not better than a serial, element by element execution of
    the vector product.
    the serial SIMD w/o threads is also not faster than the serial execution.

The vec8prod algorithm is highly parallelizable, so one can 
   calc the speedup as time 1 processor / time p processors 
   and estimate communication costs as latency 
   including context switching if threads are used 
   and amount of memory needed and memory bandwidth and
   machine network bandwidth
   for the parallel model.
