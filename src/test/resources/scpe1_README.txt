OR-Library is a collection of test data sets for a variety of Operations Research (OR) problems.

These test data sets can be accessed via the WWW using the links below.

OR-Library was originally described in J.E.Beasley, "OR-Library: distributing test problems by electronic mail", Journal of the Operational Research Society 41(11) (1990) pp1069-1072.

Those concerned as to any legal issues associated with using the test data sets in OR-Library should see

The format of these test problems is:
number of rows (m), number of columns (n)
for each column j (j=1,...,n): the cost of the column, the
number of rows that it covers followed by a list of the rows 
that it covers
