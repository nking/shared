//Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
//  Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
//  Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
//  Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

//            used by projects.
// crate root is a source file and is the root module of the crate.
//    e.g. main.rs
// a package is a bundle of 1 or more crates that provides a set of functionality.
//   it contains a Cargo.toml file.
//   can contain 1 or more binary crates, but only 1 library crate.
//   package directory has its own src/lib.rs
