Newman 2006, &quot;Modularity and community structure in networks&quot;
https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0602124.pdf

modularity is a graph quality function over possible divisions of a network.
...
The modularity is, up to a multiplicative constant, the number of edges
 * falling within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with
 * edges placed at random. (A precise mathematical formulation is given below.)
 * The modularity can be either positive or negative, with positive values
 * indicating the possible presence of community structure. Thus, one can search
 * for community structure precisely by looking for the divisions of a network
 * that have positive, and preferably large, values of the modularity.
 
 on a spectral approximation:
 
 maximizing the term involving the leading eigenvalue and completely ignoring all the
others turns out to be effective here... ignoring the inconvenient
fact that it is not possible to make s perfectly parallel to
u1 and go ahead and maximize the term in Î²1 anyway.
Given that we are free to choose the sizes of our two
groups of vertices, the greatest value of the coefficient

               matrix e is upper right triangle or eij is split in half between
