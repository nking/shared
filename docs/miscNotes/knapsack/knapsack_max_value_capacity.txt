===========================================================
max value for capacity:
    Given a set of n items, each with a mass and a value,
    determine the number of each item to include in a collection
    so that the total weight W is less than or equal to a given limit
    capacity and the total value is as large as possible.
  
basic outline for all capacity methods:

    int[] tab = new int[capacity + 1];
    int i, wc, t, c, wc2;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ... specialized weight logic for each knapsack type ...
    }
    return tab[capacity];

0-1:
        // since tab holds current i and previous i results,
        // need to traverse weights from high to low
        // to avoid including an updated low wc2 in current wc
        for (wc = capacity; wc >= weights[i]; --wc) {
            wc2 = wc - weights[i];
            tab[wc] = Math.max(tab[wc], tab[wc2] + values[i]);
        }

Bounded:
        // since tab holds current i and previous i results,
        // need to traverse weights from high to low
        // to avoid including an updated low wc2 in current wc
        for (wc = capacity; wc >= weights[i]; --wc) {
            for (q = 1; q <= quantities[i]; ++q) {
                wc2 = wc - q * weights[i];
                if (wc2 >= 0) {
                    tab[wc] = Math.max(tab[wc], tab[wc2] + q * values[i]);
                }
            }
        }

Unbounded:
        // cannot traverse weight sum in reverse order here.
        // traverse wc from 1 to target to be able to 
        // add current wc2 counts to current count sum
        for (wc = weights[i]; wc <= capacity; wc++) {
            wc2 = wc - weights[i];
            tab[wc] = Math.max(tab[wc], tab[wc2] + values[i]);
        }
