the problem is to determine the max value one can
put in the knapsack given a target weight 
and given that the items can be taken as fractions
instead of 0-1.

the solution is greedy and O(n*log(n)).
   calc vw[i] = value[i]/weight[i] for each item.
   descending sort by vw
   loop over desc sorted vw 
   take as much of each item as can while maintaing sum <= target
